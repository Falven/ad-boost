# Boost C++ Libraries

The Boost project provides free peer-reviewed portable C++ source libraries.

We emphasize libraries that work well with the C++ Standard Library. Boost
libraries are intended to be widely useful, and usable across a broad spectrum
of applications. The Boost license encourages both commercial and non-commercial use
and does not require attribution for binary use. 

The project website is www.boost.org, where you can obtain more information and
[download](https://www.boost.org/users/download/) the current release.

## Info

This is a partial port of the Boost c++ libraries to Arduino.

## Use

* Clone the repo to your `Arduino\libraries` directory in a directory called `boost_1_76_0`

    * `git clone https://github.com/Falven/ad-boost boost_1_76_0`

* Include the library in your sketch

    ```cpp
    #include <boost_1_76_0.h>
    #include <boost/whatever/lib.h>
    ```
